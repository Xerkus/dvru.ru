# dvru.ru

This is rewrite of the dvru.ru project, long obsolete and, frankly, mostly
irrelevant in modern web landscape.

Rewrite goal is to serve as an example of relatively modern web development for
local community. Hopefully nudging them to replace some of the obsolete
practices still in wide use. I treat this project as a playground and I will
utilize approaches that provide little benefit at a small scale but get
considerably more useful as the scalability and availability requirements
increase.
